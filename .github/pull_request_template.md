## Thank you very much for contributing to the development of our product! 

### Before creating a pull request, we want to make sure that you're aware of some constraints:

- We use Github as one of several ways to distribute our product, but we don't use Git as our internal VCS
- The files in this repository are automatically created from our internal VCS during the release process
- All changes made solely through Git/Github (like merging pull requests) will be lost after the next release
- PRs that are specific to Git/Github will be rejected if they conflict with other ways of distribution

So, in order to make your PR permanent, we have to transfer it to our internal VCS. It will be reviewed and tested and eventually become visible in this repository after the next release. Therefore, even if your PR is acceppted, it may not be merged via Git/Github.
